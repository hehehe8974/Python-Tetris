# Python Tetris
Recreation of the game Tetris using Python by Taehyun Lee.
I do not offer any licenses for this project.
## How it is made
Pygame is used the game to create controls and import assets easily. It is made using a grid of rows and columns that represent spaces and blocks using different colors. 
The spaces would be colored black for an empty spot, white for a destined spot, and other colors as existing blocks. 
The game is heavily influenced by other Tetris-based games like tetr.io; there are many features that are inspired from tehm such as combos, 7 bag, level, score, attacks (multiplayer) and more.
## Prerequisites
Pygame is required to run the game. To install Pygame, please type in the command prompt:
```
pip3 install pygame
```
After you have installed Pygame, run the game by typing:

```
If the game is not running, please check the directory that you are in.
